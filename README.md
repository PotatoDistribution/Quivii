# Quivii

An open-source, modular Discord bot that can organize tournaments for anything and everything. 

Features:
- Stores and updates tournament information on Discord
- Automatically creates matches based on wins and losses
- Provides participants with information such as the schedule and record/score of themselves and their opponents
- Configurable for your own preferences via the source code

## Download
You can [invite the official release of the bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=873357302399393822&permissions=8&scope=bot) for the base functionality.  
Alternatively, you can download the source code **\[NOT YET AVAILBLE\]** to tinker it for yourself.

After inviting the bot, type `!help` to see a list of the commands; the bot will walk you through the steps necessary to set it up properly.
